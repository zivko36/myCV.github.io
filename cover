                <p>i think that writhing about my character is a waste of time. Characters change, behaviours are more important and are very relative to the environment your are situated in. that’s why i am going to spare you of unnecessary explanations and emotional outbursts. let’s just say i am a dedicated, loyal, analytical and detail oriented at the BACK-END but, most importantly i am lightning fast at grasping new concepts and learning in general.<br><br>
                check out my BACKGROUND.<br><br>
                the decision to chose CODING as my ultimate path came after a relatively long search. i love marketing and i am good at creating products but, i wasn't able to produce them because of luck of technical knowledge especially in the area of WEB and APP development. so, by looking for a way to bridge the gap between my marketing knowledge & experience, creativity and product development i found that in order to be able to communicate and work with people that build APPs and WEB PAGES i need to now what they know.<br><br>
                my unique bland of MARKETING Seniority and CODING Juniority can be of a use in many companies in the IT sector.<br><br>
                ideally, i would love to start as Junior JS or Python developer and grow to a Product Owner position.</p>
